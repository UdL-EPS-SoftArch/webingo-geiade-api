## Vision

**For** bingo players **who** are interested in playing bingo with other people in order to win money and have fun.

**the project** WEBingo **is an** online platform **that** allows players to:

**Unlike** existing tools, WEBingo is an awesome online bingo because it does not get profits, so prizes are higher.
